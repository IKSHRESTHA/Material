Valuation is the process of determining the current value of an asset or liability. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as for financial reporting purposes or for tax purposes. Reserving, on the other hand, is used to set aside funds to cover future liabilities. This is done to ensure that there are sufficient funds available to pay claims in the future.

In the insurance industry, valuation and reserving are closely related. Insurance companies use valuation to determine the current value of their assets and liabilities, which is then used to calculate their reserves. Reserves are set aside to cover future claims and losses.
